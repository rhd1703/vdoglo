# Introduction to VDOGLO

VDOGLO, a minimalistic and affordable video recording system that offers full HD or 4K ultra high definition video recording.

The software is Windows-based featuring excellent library functions for storage, categorization, flagging, bookmarking, and time stamping.
The interest-based retrieval function simplifies the process of locating specific videos among large archives.

Other features include auto-chaptering at every 5 minutes or 500 MB, static or dynamic watermarking during recording or editing.

The software also supports live streaming and simultaneous recording on multiple monitors.
VDOGLO's efficient and proprietary video compression codec enables smooth running and effective digital enhancement, even during PowerPoint and Keynote presentations.

The software allows recording with impressive detail and rich, vivid colors, and can enhance 1K 2-megapixel videos to nearly 4K resolution.

## Tutorial Intro

Let's discover **VDOGLO in less than 5 minutes**.

## Getting Started

Get started by **creating a new site**.

Or **try Docusaurus immediately** with **[docusaurus.new](https://docusaurus.new)**.

### What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 18.0 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.

## Generate a new site

Generate a new Docusaurus site using the **classic template**.

The classic template will automatically be added to your project after you run the command:

```bash
npm init docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Docusaurus.

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```bash
cd my-website
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes.
